# Mandelbrot-Set
Fast visualization of the Mandelbrot set in JavaScript using workers

You can experiment by changing the colormap, number of workers, number of repetitions of the colormap, number of maximum iterations.

You can also reverse the colormap, input and edit a new custom colormap and visualize the iteration points.
